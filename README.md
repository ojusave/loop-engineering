# Loop Engineering

An agent skill for doing real work through bounded, evidence-backed feedback loops.

Loop Engineering gives coding agents a compact operating system for tasks that
need more than a one-shot answer. It establishes what success means, selects
only the checks that matter, measures each meaningful attempt, corrects failed
strategies, and stops with an honest status and evidence level.

Use it for engineering, product and UI work, accessibility, research, strategy,
public writing, and reusable agent prompts.

## What it changes

Without a loop, an agent can mistake activity for progress: a build passes, a
page renders, a draft sounds polished, or a handoff template exists. This skill
requires evidence tied to the intended result.

Each invocation:

1. Defines the starting point, target, proof requirement, and guardrails.
2. Selects the smallest useful engineering, UX, research, editorial, or
   verification checks.
3. Runs bounded observe → predict → act → measure → learn cycles.
4. Changes strategy when evidence contradicts the current approach.
5. Separates artifact verification from outcome validation.
6. Stops as `COMPLETE`, `NEEDS HUMAN JUDGMENT`, `BLOCKED`, `NOT FEASIBLE`, or
   `STAGNATED`.

## Install

### Recommended: Skills CLI

If you have Node.js installed, use the open-source
[Skills CLI](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills):

```bash
npx skills add ojusave/loop-engineering
```

The installer downloads the skill directly from GitHub, detects supported
agents, and lets you choose project or global installation. This repository is
not an npm package and does not need a `package.json`; `npx` runs the installer,
not Loop Engineering itself.

For a non-interactive global installation to Codex:

```bash
npx skills add ojusave/loop-engineering \
  --skill loop-engineering --agent codex --global --yes
```

The Skills CLI collects anonymous installation telemetry by default. Set
`DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1` for the command if you prefer to opt out.

### Manual Git installation

The shared `.agents/skills` location is recognized by Codex, Cursor, GitHub
Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and Windsurf / Devin Desktop.

#### Personal installation

Available across your projects:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
git clone https://github.com/ojusave/loop-engineering.git \
  "$HOME/.agents/skills/loop-engineering"
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$HOME\.agents\skills"
git clone https://github.com/ojusave/loop-engineering.git `
  "$HOME\.agents\skills\loop-engineering"
```

#### Project installation

To version the skill with a project, add it as a submodule:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/skills
git submodule add \
  https://github.com/ojusave/loop-engineering.git \
  .agents/skills/loop-engineering
```

If your agent does not scan `.agents/skills`, use its native path from the
table below.

## Installation by agent

Paths were checked against the linked first-party documentation on July 14, 2026.

| Agent | Project location | Personal/global location | Invoke | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI Codex | `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | Mention `$loop-engineering`, or choose it from `/skills` | [Codex skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills) |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.claude/skills/loop-engineering` | `/loop-engineering` | [Claude Code skills](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/loop-engineering` or `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.cursor/skills/loop-engineering` or `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `/loop-engineering` | [Cursor Agent Skills](https://cursor.com/docs/skills) |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/skills/loop-engineering`, `.claude/skills/loop-engineering`, or `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.copilot/skills/loop-engineering` or `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `/loop-engineering`; in Copilot CLI, use `/skills reload` after installing | [GitHub Copilot skills](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/add-skills) |
| Gemini CLI | `.gemini/skills/loop-engineering` or `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.gemini/skills/loop-engineering` or `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | Ask Gemini to use `loop-engineering`; inspect or reload with `/skills` | [Gemini CLI skills](https://geminicli.com/docs/cli/using-agent-skills/) |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/loop-engineering`, `.claude/skills/loop-engineering`, or `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.config/opencode/skills/loop-engineering`, `~/.claude/skills/loop-engineering`, or `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | Ask OpenCode to use `loop-engineering`; it loads through the `skill` tool | [OpenCode skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) |
| Windsurf / Devin Desktop | `.windsurf/skills/loop-engineering` or `.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.codeium/windsurf/skills/loop-engineering` or `~/.agents/skills/loop-engineering` | `@loop-engineering` | [Cascade skills](https://docs.devin.ai/desktop/cascade/skills) |
| Cline | `.cline/skills/loop-engineering`, `.clinerules/skills/loop-engineering`, or `.claude/skills/loop-engineering` | `~/.cline/skills/loop-engineering` | `/loop-engineering` | [Cline skills](https://docs.cline.bot/customization/skills) |

### Gemini CLI installer

Gemini CLI can also install the repository directly:

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/ojusave/loop-engineering
```

Add `--scope workspace` to install it only for the current project.

### Native-path installation

Replace `<skills-directory>` with any directory from the table:

```bash
mkdir -p <skills-directory>
git clone https://github.com/ojusave/loop-engineering.git \
  <skills-directory>/loop-engineering
```

The final structure must keep the complete skill folder together:

```text
<skills-directory>/
└── loop-engineering/
    ├── SKILL.md
    ├── agents/
    ├── references/
    └── scripts/
```

Do not copy only `SKILL.md`. The skill routes work to its references and uses
bundled scripts for deterministic state, handoff, prompt, claim, and editorial
checks.

## Use it

Invoke the skill explicitly with the syntax your agent supports, then state the
actual task:

```text
loop: reproduce and fix this checkout bug, then verify the real flow
```

```text
use loop to add this onboarding flow with responsive and accessible UI
```

```text
loop this task: research and write the article without generic AI prose
```

```text
loop: create a reusable prompt for another coding agent and test its failure cases
```

Loop Engineering is designed for explicit invocation. Its instructions tell
compatible agents not to trigger it for incidental mentions of a programming
loop, event loop, or feedback loop. Agent behavior ultimately depends on the
host and model.

## Update

For an installation managed by the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills update
```

For a personal clone, set the path to the directory where you installed the
skill:

```bash
skill_dir="$HOME/.agents/skills/loop-engineering"
git -C "$skill_dir" pull --ff-only
```

If you used an agent's native directory, change `skill_dir` to that location.

For a project submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote .agents/skills/loop-engineering
```

Reload skills using your agent's command or restart the agent if the update is
not detected automatically.

## Uninstall

For a project installation managed by the Skills CLI:

```bash
npx skills remove loop-engineering
```

Add `--global` if you installed the skill globally.

Delete the `loop-engineering` directory from the location where you installed
it. For a Git submodule, remove it using your project's normal
submodule-removal workflow.

Loop state is stored separately under a project's `.loop/` directory only for
deep or genuinely multi-cycle tasks. Removing the skill does not delete
existing loop state.

## Requirements and trust

- The core skill is Markdown and follows the
  [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification).
- Basic Markdown-only use does not require Python. Python 3 is required when
  the workflow uses bundled scripts for persistent state, handoffs, or
  deterministic checks. On Windows, substitute `py -3` when `python3` is
  unavailable.
- Review `SKILL.md` and the bundled scripts before installing any third-party
  skill. Skills can instruct an agent to execute commands and modify files.
- Loop Engineering does not grant broader authority. It still requires human
  approval for production deployment, destructive operations, purchases,
  external publication, permission changes, privacy-sensitive access, and
  unsafe migrations.

## Repository layout

```text
loop-engineering/
├── SKILL.md                  # Compact router and invariant gates
├── agents/openai.yaml        # Optional Codex UI metadata
├── references/               # Specialist protocols
└── scripts/                  # Deterministic checks
```

The skill uses progressive disclosure: the agent sees the name and description
first, loads `SKILL.md` when invoked, and reads specialist references only when
the task needs them.
