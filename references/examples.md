## Activation

Activate:

```text
loop: fix the login bug and verify it
```

```text
use loop to build a polished responsive settings flow
```

```text
loop this task: research and write the article without AI slop
```

Do not activate:

```text
Why is this for loop slow?
```

```text
Explain the JavaScript event loop.
```

## Small code fix

Prompt:

```text
loop: fix the incorrect timezone conversion
```

Route:

```text
parent -> engineering -> parent integration
```

Evidence:

- reproduction
- targeted test
- relevant broader tests
- diff inspection

## Product feature

Prompt:

```text
loop: add an onboarding flow for creating a service
```

Route:

```text
parent
  -> freshness/portability if dependencies are considered
  -> product UX experience contract
  -> engineering
  -> rendered UI
  -> accessibility
  -> parent integration
```

False success to reject:

- API works
- page renders
- component tests pass
- no mobile or error state checked

## Backend feature with no UI

Prompt:

```text
loop: add idempotency to webhook processing
```

Route:

```text
parent -> engineering -> concurrency/data review -> parent integration
```

Do not invoke UI specialists unless an operator interface changes.

## Framework choice

Prompt:

```text
loop: choose and integrate a workflow library
```

Route:

```text
parent -> freshness/portability -> engineering -> integration
```

Required evidence:

- project fit
- current official docs and release/support state
- license
- alternatives
- adapter boundary
- migration path

## Research-backed article

Prompt:

```text
loop: research and write a strong article about developers delegating setup to agents. No AI slop and no em dashes.
```

Route:

```text
parent -> research -> article -> editorial -> fact check -> parent integration
```

False success to reject:

- polished generic prose
- factual claims with no thesis
- a thesis or talk promise a competent generalist could produce without the author's evidence, access, demonstration, synthesis, or judgment
- copied Theo, swyx, or Garry Tan cadence
- inspiring ending unsupported by the article
- any em dash in the final draft

## Conference abstract

Prompt:

```text
loop: make this engineering conference title and description impossible to ignore
```

Route:

```text
parent -> speaker evidence/access inventory -> audience value -> argument contract -> editorial -> promise verification -> parent
```

False success to reject:

- a vivid title attached to generic best practices
- biography or employer scale used instead of a finding
- an empty teaser that withholds the talk's actual contribution
- invented proprietary data, experience, framework names, or organizational bets
- takeaways obtainable from common knowledge and the supplied public context

## Strategy

Prompt:

```text
loop: decide whether we should build or partner for this feature
```

Route:

```text
parent -> research as needed -> strategy -> feasibility review -> parent
```

Output should contain one recommendation, assumptions, tradeoffs, and a reversible first test.

## Prompt generation

Prompt:

```text
loop: create a prompt for Cursor to build a polished open-source admin tool
```

Route:

```text
parent -> prompt generation -> downstream simulation -> product/UI prompt review -> parent
```

The output prompt must itself route product UX before implementation and rendered UI after implementation.

## Outcome-contract examples

### Code bug

```text
Outcome owner or beneficiary: API callers
Outcome class: state change
Baseline: duplicate webhook delivery creates two orders
Target state: repeated delivery with the same event ID creates exactly one order
Intended context of use: integration test and production-like worker runtime
Primary measure and threshold: one persisted order after two identical deliveries
Guardrails: distinct event IDs still create distinct orders; no lost notification
Required evidence state: OUTCOME VALIDATED
Next decision or use: merge the fix
```

Passing unit tests without exercising repeated delivery is only `ARTIFACT VERIFIED` and does not satisfy this contract.

### Research decision

```text
Outcome owner or beneficiary: engineering lead choosing a workflow library
Outcome class: decision
Baseline: alternatives and compatibility are unresolved
Target state: one option can be selected with bounded migration and maintenance risk
Primary measure and threshold: required capabilities, license, support status, and migration path are resolved for the top options
Guardrails: do not introduce avoidable lock-in or unsupported software
Required evidence state: DECISION READY
Next decision or use: approve adoption or decline all options
```

A long source list without a decision threshold is not `DECISION READY`.

### Conference abstract with missing evidence

```text
Outcome owner or beneficiary: target conference attendee and speaker
Outcome class: artifact
Baseline: the description promises generic reliability advice
Target state: target readers can identify the talk's unique, deliverable learning promise
Primary measure and threshold: representative readers distinguish the promise from a generic overview; the speaker confirms every claim is supportable
Guardrails: do not invent telemetry, experience, findings, or organizational bets
Required evidence state: OUTCOME VALIDATED
Next decision or use: submit or publish the abstract
```

If the speaker's distinctive evidence is unavailable, stop `BLOCKED / NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE`. Do not invent a framework and call the copy complete.

## Handoff examples

These show completed lifecycle phases. Never copy all possible states into a return.

### Successful return and parent closure

```text
FROM: engineering
TO: rendered-ui
STATUS: CLOSED

HANDOFF REQUEST
Goal: Verify the first-time service creation path.
Artifact: Running application at http://localhost:3000.
Parent success: A first-time user creates a service without hidden knowledge; proof required is OUTCOME VALIDATED.
Current state: Build and API integration tests pass; the rendered flow is unverified.
Already verified: npm test; npm run build.
Remaining uncertainty: Mobile hierarchy and permission-error recovery.
Constraints: Preserve design tokens, payloads, and route behavior.
Specialist task: Exercise the flow at 1440px and 390px, then trigger a permission error and recover.
Acceptance checks: The primary action is identifiable; creation succeeds; the error names the problem and offers a working recovery action.
Predicted contribution: Direct flow evidence should close the gap left by build and API checks.

SPECIALIST RETURN
Return status: PASS
Findings: The primary action was visible without scrolling at both widths. The permission error named the missing role and the retry succeeded after the role changed.
Changes: None; review only.
Evidence: Browser run at 1440x900 and 390x844; screenshots service-desktop.png, service-mobile.png, and permission-error.png.
Actual observation: Service creation completed once at each width and once after permission recovery; baseline had no rendered-flow evidence.
Evidence state: OUTCOME VALIDATED
Unresolved after review: Screen-reader output was not part of this rendered-UI handoff and remains assigned to accessibility review.
Recommended next step: Parent accepts this return after integrating the separate accessibility result.

PARENT CLOSURE
Parent disposition: ACCEPTED
Integration evidence: Parent reran service creation after accessibility changes at 390px; creation and permission recovery still succeeded.
```

### Blocked return and parent response

```text
FROM: audience-value
TO: speaker
STATUS: CLOSED

HANDOFF REQUEST
Goal: Confirm the conference abstract's claimed production finding.
Artifact: Draft abstract stating that queued work predicts saturation earlier than request rate.
Parent success: Every distinctive promise is supportable before submission.
Current state: The claim appears in the draft but no source or speaker confirmation is recorded.
Remaining uncertainty: Whether production data supports the comparative claim.
Constraints: Do not invent telemetry, results, or privileged access.
Specialist task: Provide a shareable aggregate result or narrow the claim.
Acceptance checks: Evidence identifies the population, comparison, and limitation, or the unsupported claim is removed.
Predicted contribution: Speaker evidence would make the promise verifiable; its absence should force rework rather than polished speculation.

SPECIALIST RETURN
Return status: BLOCKED
Findings: The available notes distinguish the signals conceptually but contain no comparison showing earlier prediction.
Changes: None.
Evidence: Speaker notes sections 2–4; no aggregate chart, query result, or approved recollection supports the timing claim.
Actual observation: The load-bearing claim remains unsupported.
Evidence state: NO RELIABLE EVIDENCE
Unresolved after review: Whether the speaker can provide an approved aggregate result.
Recommended next step: Remove the comparative claim or wait for speaker evidence.

PARENT CLOSURE
Parent disposition: REWORK
Integration evidence: The parent removed the unsupported timing claim and returned the abstract to argument review; submission remains incomplete.
```
